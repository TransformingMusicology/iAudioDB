Requirements:

* CAMUS requires BWToolkit, which was not included for space reasons. It is freely available at http://brandonwalkin.com/bwtoolkit/. The BWToolkitFramework.framework file should be placed into this folder prior to recompilation. 
* All other libraries are included, with their binaries patched to allow for their bundling within the CAMUS application.
